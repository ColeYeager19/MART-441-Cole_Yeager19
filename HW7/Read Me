I greatly struggled with this task. I couldn't find a way to define multiple objects in the array. All the titles work but each time I added new definitions 
they would be placed in the wrong place or wouldn't appear at all. In the end I had to go back to almost the original copy to get even this much working. 
I feel my work this week was a genuine failure and I will need further help on this topic moving forward.
